NettyCoder is a custom HTTP server for encoding videos. Built with Java, Netty, and Jackson, and SnakeYAML, this project
utilizes test-driven development (TDD), continuous integration (CI), JSON technology for requests and responses, YAML
for configuration, and a multi-threaded HTTP protocol.

## Building
1. Download or clone repository
2. Build project with Gradle by using the command `./gradlew` (refer to the
   [Java CI with Gradle GitHub workflow](./.github/workflows/gradle.yml) for more information)

## Using
1. Run the application with Java 8 or above (e.g. `java -jar nettycoder.jar`).

## Notes
* This is a work in progress, and more functionality will slowly be added overtime.
